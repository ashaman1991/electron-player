# electron-player

Simple player built with electron

# Running the project:

`git clone https://github.com/ashaman1991/electron-player.git`

`npm install`

`npm start`

# Issues: 

- make progress bar work for mp3 files(now works only on URLs), onProgress callback is called only once
- no animation on 'Add' button

# Features to implement:

- Display file metadata(Title,  Artist etc.)
- Playlist navigation
- Saving/loading playlists
